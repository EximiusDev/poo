The term open source describes practices in production and development that promote access to 

the end product's source materials. Some consider open source a philosophy, others consider it a 

pragmatic methodology. Before the term open source became widely adopted, developers and producers 

used a variety of phrases to describe the concept; open source gained hold with the rise of the Internet, 

and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing source code. Opening the source code enabled 

a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.

Subsequently, the new phrase "open-source software" was born to describe the environment that the new 

copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues created.
